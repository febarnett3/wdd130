        History
          Discovered in 1883, its immortal ability wasn't discovered until the mid-1990s. Students Giorgio 
          Bavestrello and Christian Sommer gathered Turritopsis polyps and stored them until medusae were 
          released. They continued to observe the jellyfish and found that under stress, the medusae would 
          drop to the bottom of the jar and develop into polyps without fertilization or the traditional 
          larval stage.
          Birth & Reproduction
          The immortal jellyfish begins its life cycle as a planula, a larva that can move and settle on the
           surface while swimming. After settling, the planula will grow into a single polyp and then 
           reproduce asexually to form a colony. Once the colony is large enough, it will produce and release
            a large number of identical newborn jellyfish (also known as the medusa). The release of eggs or 
            sperm into the water column by newborn jellyfish as they mature allows for the development of 
            extra planula and external fertilization.
        Fun Facts
          Is about the size of your pinky
          Has no brains or a heart
          They are hitchhikers, hitching rides on on cargo ships that use seawater for ballast
          has between 8 and 90 tentacles
          The immortal jellyfish reproduces both sexually and asexually
          Big ships have created big currents spreading them globally
          contain only a basic network of neurons that allow them to sense their environment
          They do sting, but they are not poisonous

          Size: 4-5 mm tall and wide
        Overview: 
          The immortal jellyfish exists in two forms: polyp form and medusa form. Though it usually starts 
          as polyp and transitions into a medusa, it can revert back in its forms through a process called 
          transdifferentiation. Transdifferentatiaton is, according to the medical dictionary, “The conversion 
          of stem cells derived from one tissue into cells normally found in another tissue.” This allows them 
          to biologically live forever because when they reach a certain age it can decide when its cells 
          convert backwards.

        FAQ
          How old is the oldest immortal jellyfish?
            You might be curious about the age of the oldest immortal jellyfish, but there is no answer. 
            There has been no long-term observation of turritopsis dohrnii in a laboratory, and there is no other way 
            to determine an individual's age.
          Won’t they populate the whole earth if they are immortal?
            They are only biologically immortal; predators can still eat them (and they certainly are eaten). 
            Nonetheless, because cargo ships can easily transport them worldwide, they are seen in previously unseen
            territories.
          What do they look like?
            If you want to see an immortal jellyfish in the ocean, keep in mind that it is very small. Turritopsis 
            dohrnii is bell-shaped and can grow to be 4.5mm (0.18 inch) tall and wide. They are very small creatures. Turritopsis larvae have only 8 tentacles and grow to be 1 mm tall, whereas adults can have up to 90 tentacles. It has a bright red stomach. Dohrnii polyps are made up of stolons and branches that can produce medusa buds.
          Are there immortal jellyfishes on sale?
            While we have heard of some being sold in Japan, they are extremely rare. It is possible for them to be
            sold, but we are unaware of any reliable source of nutricula or dohrnii for sale.
